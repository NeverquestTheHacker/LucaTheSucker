Our Systems, during their normal ativity, collect some essential personal data that are implicit in the Internet's protocols of communication.

We define it "Security Mode". When our systems detect something strange (by analyzing the data mentioned above) in someone's traffic (generated as example by Bots, Botnets, Malwares, unallowed Scrapers, Malicious Users, Security Issues Scanners, Port Scanners), they start to collect all the data that will be useful in case of future Legal Actions or Security Patches. When this mode is enabled, all the data available from the malicious User are stored for a standard period of 14 days, or, in case of Legal Actions, until needed.
